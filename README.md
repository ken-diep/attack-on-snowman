# attack-on-snowman
A demo Unity game I made as part of a lab for the junior programmer pathway on Unity Learn.

The aim of the game is to hold out against the endless waves of demonic snowmen for as long as you can, equipped only with a snowball turret (which luckily can make infinite snowballs).

This is my first project on Unity where I wasn't merely following a set of instructions. It was a bit over-ambitious but I've started to internalize the use of asset hierarchies, object relationships, C#, etc.

Assets used (all free from Unity asset store, shout out to creators):

Fatty Poly Turret Free

I would still like to get round to:

Implementing enemy spawner  
Adding a start and game over message  
Adding enemy health for snowball hit  
Polishing visuals  
Uploading the game so it can be played in browser  
Tidying this repository, inc. screenshots!
